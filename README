The goal of this article is to implement the following scenario:

The central node creates a blockchain.
Other (wallet) node connects to it and downloads the blockchain.
One more (miner) node connects to the central node and downloads the blockchain.
The wallet node creates a transaction.
The miner nodes receives the transaction and keeps it in its memory pool.
When there are enough transactions in the memory pool, the miner starts mining a new block.
When a new block is mined, itâ€™s send to the central node.
The wallet node synchronizes with the central node.
User of the wallet node checks that their payment was successful.
